You will need a couple of servos, pan/tilt bracket and Pololu Maestro servo controller for pan/tilt functionality.
But code will still work without it.

But,  You will need a Google Coral AI USB accellerator. 
# 1. Use Python 3.9 Coral won't work with later versions of python I used pyenv to use this version
# 2. Install Python dependencies: cv2, flask, Coral AI, maestro code with if you want to hook up servos to move
# 3. Run "python3 main.py".
# 4. Navigate the browser to the local webpage. 

```
# Usage
python3 main.py
```
